## API Reference 
I have used an APi Called Platzi Fake Store API for prototyping my e-commerce webapp marketplace. Platzi Fake Store API can be used with any type of project that needs products, users, categories, authentication, and users in JSON format.
This API includes features like:

    ✅ All CRUD Operations
    ✅ REST API
    ✅ GraphQL
    ✅ Pagination
    ✅ Auth with JWT
    ✅ Upload Files
    ✅ Filter products by category, title and price range
    ✅ Create users and check to see if they already exist
    ✅ Postman and Insomnia files
    ✅ Product images generated by AI
